## Technologies used
Pandas
Numpy
Plotly

## Data Preprocessing and cleaning
There are various discrepancies in the dataset like some country reports confirmed and deaths by province, but recovered by entire country's total.
Some countries' Recovered lat long are smaller than Confirmed,Deaths lat long while vice versa for other countries.
70-80% of time was spent to clean up the data


## Desired Outcome
An animated chart to visualize from the beginning of Covid-19 till date. To provide a tracker to track daily cases.
